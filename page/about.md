Title: About Me



When I was 9, my father took me to his work at the Strategic Air Command, an placed me in front of a terminal. He typed something, and said "Go ahead and type, but do not press the blue button." Do Not Press The Blue Button. I pressed the blue button, which caused several missiles to be launched. I walked away hoping no one would notice. In hindsight I had just instigated the big bad login prompt, thereby taking me out of whatever my dad had brought forth to occupy my time with. But I was hooked and needed to know more.

Not long after I found myself in the local library in front of a Pet Commodore. The librarian knew enough to show me how to load a rogue-like from a cassette tape, and where the book on BASIC was located. I figured out how to list and modify the code so I could win easily, by myself.

Flash forward to now. I've released a smidgen of C, and set forth upon the world enough perl and php to apologize for. Sorry about that. The good news is that it's closed source and only the maintainer will hate me with a passion of a thousand suns. Enough about that, here's what gets me excited: Less testing, more stable code.

My personal project stems from my days of playing lpmuds. The innovation lpmud has is that it comes equipped with a dsl called lpc. Invariably a subset of players would want to take on the role of game creators, and needed to learn lpc to do it. The problem with lpc, is that it has little educational value. So, I envision a mudlike, in the way that Faster Than Light is a roguelike, written in haskell, with a denotational DSL that can be used to propagate what we now know about solid, economical programming practices. Step one is writing a tradewars clone, to familiarize myself with functional reactive programming. Then moving on to a new project to suss out various subsystems of the primary project.

This is what I want from a career opportunity right now: a chance to leverage my skills as they exist, to grow them and to learn new ones compatible with business goals. My expectation is that I will find myself using Haskell and Javascript together, and that sounds exciting. But for my personal project taking up my spare time, I'd be sorting that out right now. But I have no doubts as to my ability to get up to speed with Javascript best practices, should the need arise.

At the same time, I'm open to other opportunities. I'm interested in working with people who share my passion for the craft. Let's get to work.

## Unit Testing

I'm really bad about making sure I have good test coverage. When first
putting this project together I only decided to include tests to portray
myself as someone who is diligent about testing personal projects. As it
turns out the unit tests I made actually caught one of my functions
as only being partially defined. That combined with problems with my game
[Emporos](/blog/2015/11/momentio-testing.md), I have repented of my evil ways.
